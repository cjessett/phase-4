Can you believe it's time for phase three already? We are so proud of you all
for making it this far. You've all put in so much hard work. And you can now
develop real things on the web!

You're a web developer now, and the extent to which you energize that label is
a matter of the time and effort you give to continued, focused practice.

So yeah. Let's get ready to work even harder.

## Goals

Our goals for this phase are to teach you the disciplines that will enable you
to have discussions in interviews where you are being assessed on:

* your ability to understand technical architecutres and discuss their merits
* the ability to ship code that has reasonable quality control (tests, clean git commits) around it
* the ability to collaborate on a multi-day project _as a team_ under guidance of a non-technical influence

## TL;DR

Finish the core work listed here by Monday morning.

Part of that core work is to prepare a 5-10 minute talk and demo of a Rails
feature. Claim your topic in the wiki to avoid duplicate choices.

Your blog must be written and deployed by Monday. You'll notice the README is
really short. You'll have to lean on Google and one another to find good
resources to guide you through the process.

Use model/migration/controller generators only 1x to see the file structure,
then only use migration generators for the rest of the phase.

READ, RESEARCH, & DIG INTO THE ERRORS!

This phase is gonna be hard, and yes, you should still ask for help!

## Long version

We'll be kicking off the Phase 3 on Monday by diving in to Rails (whoo!
Raaaaaaails). Some parts of Rails will look similar to what you've been doing
in Sinatra -- others won't. Along the way, we'll be diving into feature
testing, client-side JavaScript frameworks, and PROJECTS.

The entire section list 'core' in the pre-work is your weekend work.  We expect
each of you to build and deploy a blog using Rails by Monday morning (read the
directions in the guide).

For deployment, you'll need to sign up for Heroku if you haven't already. See
the [Heroku docs for Rails 5][Heroku Rails5].

You may see documentation or hear from others about Rails' generators. Do not
use them to create code. Unless used carefully they will add features you don't
need and confuse issues that are really quite simple. They're handy when you're
without wifi and can't remember something &mdash; but they're not something you
should lean on. Most professional Rails developers never use the generators.
Seriously, you'll thank yourself later for being diligent now and letting your
fingers start remembering how those files come together.

Phase 3 is about ramping up for the real world. You'll be treated less like
students and more like professional developers. Answers will not be served on a
platter; rather, you'll have to take the initiative to pursue solutions on your
own. We aren't looking for clever solutions (non-coincidentally, interviewers
aren't either); instead, we'll make sure your process is disciplined, your `git`
log is spotless, and your code is well-written, tested, and robust. Consider us
more your tech leads who you go to more for design decisions rather than "why
isn't this working???" sort of answers.  This will push you all on reading the
errors and digging in on your own, but you all need more practice with that.

Lastly the guidance and resources provide in this document are not meant to be
"read and forgotten." You can use this starting page and these resources as a
great place to get unstuck. Remember the console, your peers, your imagination,
and your ability to reason through a problem are your greatest teachers.

### Core

**Setup**

- Use [this process](../resources/rails-setup.md) for creating a new rails app.

**Prep for Monday**

* Read [Intro to Phase 3](../resources/intro-to-p3.md)
* Read [Github Workflow](../resources/git-workflow.md)

**Rails**

- Read the [section in the Overview on Rails](../resources/intro-to-p3.md#on-rails).
* Go through [Learning Rails](../phase-3-prep/learning-rails.md)
* Watch a talk on rails (see below)
* [Build a Rails Blog](../../../../rails-blog-challenge) (Avoid using devise)
* We have assigned you each one [Railsy talks (Week 1)](../resources/railsy-talk-topics.md). One will be on Monday afternoon--research and prepare for it! We want to see some concrete example code, not just a walkthrough of the documentation. Also pick one [Gemsy Talk (week 2)](../resources/gemsy_talk_topics.md) of your choice. These are short talks which you will give to the rest of the cohort.  When you pick yours, update the [Lightning Talks Schedule](../resources/lightning-talks-schedule.md).
* Deploy your Rails app to Heroku **from your personal laptop**
- [Cool Stuff in Rails](../resources/cool-stuff-in-rails.md): **VERY IMPORTANT**. Seeing some of these helpers and patterns will make learning the work of Rails much easier. Time invested here (perhaps attempting "fuzzy" experiments as opportunity in your Rails Blog codebase will have great benefit)
