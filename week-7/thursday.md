**Prep for Tomorrow**

Tomorrow we will pivot to "Advanced Topics in JavaScript: ES6, `node`, `npm`,
and ReactJS." These are exciting technolgies that are very much in demand.

We will learn to write JavaScript applications on the server that you use from
the command-line using NodeJS and its package ecosystem, `npm`. We will also
use those tools to build web servers which serve complex JavaScript
applications written in ES6 and then translated to ReactJS. By doing to you'll
understan the _why_ of React _as well as_ the _what to type_ of React.

The following videos will be used to prepare you for work tomorrow:

* https://talks.devbootcamp.com/p3-js-module-day-01-lo-3-5
* https://talks.devbootcamp.com/p3-js-module-day-01-lo-6-7

Both the NodeJS ecosystem and React are advanced usages of JavaScript. In order
to ensure that you're **not** struggling to follow this new material, you
**need** to fully understand these following five topics. For the record,
they're also common interview topics, so understanding these topics is
practical for understanding theory _as well as_ getting past a phone screen.

1. Get an objective measure of your comfort with the
   [JavaScript InterviewExercise][interview].  Note any weakness and see if you an address it with the
   help of the following resources. If you require further help, bring questions
   to school tomorrow.
2. Read the "Beginning Advanced Topics in JavaScript: `node`, `npm`, and
   ReactJS" in tomorrow's guide. Write down any questions and bring them to
   class tomorrow.
3. Watch [JS Scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwoFkRjZvE)
4. Watch [JS Closure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQqwU2Ixu-U&index=5&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)
7. Watch [JS `this` and `bind`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIkA60I0dKU)
6. Watch [What the heck is the event loop?](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)
7. Watch [JS Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d7s3spWAzo&index=8&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)

By the end of the day tomorrow, you should be able to accomplish the following:

* Task 1: Use `node` to execute a file of JavaScript; to run a REPL
* Task 2: Configure a directory ready for using Node and NPM
* Task 3: Discover documentation in Node docs for working with filesystem
* Task 4: Build a simple Unix-based utility using Node + NPM and JavaScript
* Task 5: Extend a simple Unix application with an NPM-based package
* Task 6: Construct Node-driven test sandbox in which to run failing tests
* Task 8: Use ES6 to remediate failing unit tests and are introduced to several structures of ES6
