## Wednesday
### Client Project - Day 1/2

### Core

**Talks**

- Railsy Talks

**Group Project**

[Client Project](../../../../client-project-challenge)

You should follow this [Group Project process](../resources/group_project_process.md) to get practice with the standard development team workflow.

Today, you will:

- meet with your client to get your project's requirements
- determine your team's working process
- write out and plan your user stories
- set up your CI tools, code coverage and deployment environment
- begin working on your features

**Prep for Tomorrow**

- Read up on good commit messages
    - [5 Tips for a Better Commit Message](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message)
    - [Git Commit Message Suggestions](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- Read [Sandi Metz' Rules For Developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers).

  Note from Graham: The above link is broken (h/t Kathiee for noticing that!). I think the resource that used to be there is here now: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5 -- it's hard to tell -- but that es5 version of the style guide is deprecated, so https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/ might also be interesting. You should know the difference between es5 and es6, so that might be a good place to start!
