## Weekend

### Core

**Rails Checkpoint**

Work on this solo [rails checkpoint challenge](../../../../rails-checkpoint-challenge) and submit a PR for review
when you are finished.  Please finish it before Monday. You should observe the
same care and discipline that you observed in the group project. This solo
project, the group project, and what you learn in your final projects will
define what you're able to talk about in your interviews. If you coasted in
some place, here's the time to fix it. If someone else in your team implemented
a feature that you weren't engaged in, dig in and figure it out (refactor it?
write tests for it?) until you're _as good as the originator_.

Great developers are always learning from each other and using the code to
commune with other minds.

While it's tempting to focus on the new, shiny thing of NodeJS and NPM, please
complete this with your best effort. Many full-stack developers are fluent
in a (Ruby+Rails / Python+Django) **and** JavaScript+Node pairing. We've seen
Node developers, mid-project, utter "Shoulda done this in Rails..." We've seen
Node apps globally die suddenly because of package bundling issues. The ability
to think and reason by analogy and across platforms is a superpower. Don't lose
the chance to gain it by choosing to be monolingual.

**Firm Up ES6 Syntax**

Firm up your mastery of the JavaScript thorny points and practice using ES6.
Build trivial apps where you get to try out new ES6 SUPER POWERS. Make sure you
can model a `Dog` or a `Guitar` using the new `class` syntax. Revisit ideas
from assessments and see if you can make them just as easily in ES6 syntax.

**The Widget Pattern**

On Monday we'll cover a DBC-grown paradigm called "The Widget Pattern." It's
not proprietary, but it's "React with the guts exposed." This is a very
difficult day's work. I'd invite you to watch the lectures ahead of the lecture
that will repeat, more or less, the same content. Watch the videos for the
general "shape" and gist. This should make the lecture less challenging on
Monday

* https://talks.devbootcamp.com/click-counter-no-widget : a baseline implementation that should be familiar to p2 grads
* https://talks.devbootcamp.com/p3-js-module-day-02-lo-1-2 : a new style implementation using Widgets that don't share data
* https://talks.devbootcamp.com/p3-js-module-day-02-lo-3 : a new style implementation using Widgets that **do** share data

**RED ALERT**

If you are fuzzy on these, and you shouldn't be, make **sure** you understand these
before Monday.

Concepts you need to have firmly squared away are:

1. [JS Scope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwoFkRjZvE)
2. [JS Closure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQqwU2Ixu-U&index=5&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)
3. [JS `this` and `bind`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIkA60I0dKU)
4. [What the heck is the event loop?](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)
5. [JS Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d7s3spWAzo&index=8&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)
6. Setting up a Node project directory
7. Core ES6 language constructs: `class`, `() => {}` "fat-arrow function definitions", and `...` the "destructuring" operator

**Solo Project**

Take this opportunity to start investigating what you will pitch for final project and the feasibility.
