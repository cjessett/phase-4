<h1>Strategy for Creating React.Components</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a guideline for thinking in <code>React.Component</code>s. Obviously, nothing in programming
is entirely mechanical such that a list covers the process in all cases. If
that were the case, programming itself would be, programmed.</p>

<p>When beginning, however, this is a good start.</p>

<h2>Basic strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Create a <code>class</code> with a reasonable name that's a subclass of <code>React.Component</code>.</li>
<li>Step 2: Write JSX and return it from a <code>render()</code> method</li>
<li>Step 3: Where needed, define a <code>this.state</code> Object, set sensible defaults</li>
<li>Step 4: Configuration will be passed in and stored in a <code>this.props</code> Object</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<ul>
<li>Share state when appropriate
<ul>
<li>Child Components should be passed Parent's changing state as props</li>
<li>Child components should be passed Parent's events for updating Parent's state</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>"Reasonable Name"</h2>

<p>React.Component subclasses' names should generally be of the form <em>noun</em>. Thus
<code>class Composition extends React.Component</code> or <code>class Tweet extends
React.Component</code> but not <code>class Compsoer extends React.Component</code>. After you
read the name you can say (in your head) "component." If that makes sense, you
have a good name.</p>

<p>Teams you may work in may have other ideas on this. Whatever the choice, pick
one and be consistent!</p>
