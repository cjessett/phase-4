<h1>Strategy for Creating Widgets</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a guideline for thinking in Widgets. Obviously, nothing in programming
is entirely mechanical such that a list covers the process in all cases. If
that were the case, programming itself would be, programmed.</p>

<p>When beginning, however, this is a good start.</p>

<h2>Basic strategy</h2>

<ul>
<li>Step 1: Create a <code>class</code> with a reasonable name</li>
<li>Step 2: Turn over rendering of the display; call this method <code>render()</code> for consistency</li>
<li>Step 3: Provide a DOM hook as an argument during initialization</li>
<li>Step 4: Extract configuration to <code>this.props</code> Object, set sensible defaults in initializer, merge them</li>
<li>Step 5: Extract state to <code>this.state</code> Object, set sensible defaults; use <code>this.props</code> as needed</li>
<li>Step 6: Add behavior in the constructor to the "hooked" DOM node</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced</h2>

<ul>
<li>Share state when appropriate
<ul>
<li>Child widgets <code>register</code> as responsibilities of the parent</li>
<li>Child widgets are given a reference back to the parent</li>
<li>Children pass state-changing event signal "up"</li>
<li>Parent widget knows when to tell children to re-render</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some boilerplate typing process here can be solved by Object-Orientation and sub-classing. At that point, though, you might be better adopting a widely-understood framework e.g. React</li>
<li>Also recognize that for non-complicated interfaces, there's no shame in writing a simple event handler ("Resist over-engineering").</li>
</ul>
