## Wednesday

### React: Integrating / Practicing &amp; Top-Down ("Data-Driven" Designs)

## Goal

After this day, students will be able to:

* Process a data blob into a React site ("top-down architecture")

## Importance

In Day 3 we were lucky, we had our Components specified for us and we had a
back-end API that was tailor made to fill the Components we _saw_. But what if
you don't get a UI that you get to mark up, what if you get a big ol' JSON
Object?

While the technology choices don't change, we have to approach our design a
little bit differently. Instead of _seeing_ based on a mockup or a static site,
we have to _see_ based on looking at a JSON Object. We'll practice that today
but also integrate our learnings from the first 3 days so that they're
comfortable for us to use future projects.

## Tasks

By being able to execute the following tasks, you will have learned the
material for the day and can corroborate your learning.

Task 1: Build a mock-up from a JSON Object

## Lecture 1: Data-Driven Designs

**Challenges**

Make sure your [lil Twitter](../../../../lil-twitter-react-challenge) was able
to render the timeline with tweet components with data returned from an AJAX
call. Tune up any weaknesses from the last 2 days now.

If you're very comfortable, move on to: [my-own-reddit-react-challenge]()

**Get Ready for Final Projects**

- Investigate the feasiblity of your pitches
- Come up with ideas for Pitch Day
- Read if you can't come up with ideas: [YCombinator Request for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)
- You should follow this [Group Project process](../resources/group_project_process.md) to get practice with the standard development team workflow.
