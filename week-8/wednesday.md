## Wednesday

### React: Continued Work with React

## Goal

* Keep honing Lil Twitter
* (Instructor Discretion) Process a data blob into a React site ("top-down architecture")

## Importance

(Instructor Discretion) In Day 3 we were lucky, we had our Components specified
for us and we had a back-end API that was tailor made to fill the Components we
_saw_. But what if you don't get a UI that you get to mark up, what if you get
a big ol' JSON Object?

While the technology choices don't change, we have to approach our design a
little bit differently. Instead of _seeing_ based on a mockup or a static site,
we have to _see_ based on looking at a JSON Object. We'll practice that today
but also integrate our learnings from the first 3 days so that they're
comfortable for us to use future projects.
